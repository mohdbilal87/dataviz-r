### Data Preparation


Below is the accompanying code to reproduce the chart above. The data was manually created by studying the chart.

```{r data}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(cowplot)

df_physician_affiliation <- data.frame(speciality = c("Surgery","Anesthesiology","Urology","ENT","Radiology","Ophthalmology","Physical/Rehab","Dermatology","Family medicine","Emergency","Cardiology","Gastroenterology","Pulmonary","Ob/Gyn","All doctors","Oncology","Nephrology","Pathology","Internal medicine","Neurology","Endocrinology","Geriatrics","Pediatrics","Psychiatry","Infectious disease"),republican = c(67,65,62,61,59,57,54,53,52,51,49,49,48,47,46,43,43,42,41,40,40,37,32,24,23)) %>% mutate(democrats = 100-republican)

df_physician_affiliation <- df_physician_affiliation %>% reshape2::melt()
df_physician_affiliation$speciality <- factor(df_physician_affiliation$speciality,levels = rev(c("Surgery","Anesthesiology","Urology","ENT","Radiology","Ophthalmology","Physical/Rehab","Dermatology","Family medicine","Emergency","Cardiology","Gastroenterology","Pulmonary","Ob/Gyn","All doctors","Oncology","Nephrology","Pathology","Internal medicine","Neurology","Endocrinology","Geriatrics","Pediatrics","Psychiatry","Infectious disease")))

```

### GGPLOT2


```{r plot, tidy=FALSE, fig.width=9, fig.height=8}

  )
