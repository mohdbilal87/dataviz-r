			<abstract>These polygon features represent digitization of the glacier margins for the 37 named glaciers of Glacier National Park (GNP) and two glaciers on U.S. Forest Service’s Flathead National Forest land, derived from 2015 satellite imagery. The polygons represent only the main body portion of each glacier as it appeared in 2015 satellite imagery. Disconnected patches are not included as this dataset represents only the main body features of the named glaciers in GNP and environs. Polygons were digitized from WorldView imagery acquired on the following source dates: 20150822, 20150912, 20150915, 20150925  (World View 01 satellite). Initial digitization was completed by Melissa Brett, PSU graduate student. This set of polygons represents revisions based on supplemental imagery (20140825, 20141019, 20160915 - WorldView-01, oblique images in USGS collection, GoogleEarth collection), and local knowledge and interpretation by Dan Fagre and Lisa McKeon (USGS) in February - August, 2016. A Wacom Pro digital tablet was used by USGS staff to trace outlines and make revisions to the PSU margins. Glaciers were digitized at 1:2000 scale, with lowest off-nadir image chosen when multiple WorldView images were available for the same day. File attributes list specific photos used in analysis, including documentation of the off-nadir angle to determine imagery used. Since multiple images in time series contribute to this analysis, if previous image showed perennial snow that was absent from the glacier (bedrock visible), then that portion was deemed "seasonal/perennial snow" in subsequent photos and not included in the digitization of 2015 glacier margins.</abstract>
			<purpose>Dataset was created to develop a time series and history of glacier recession in Glacier National Park, Montana, USA. This dataset delineates the 2015 perimeters of the named glaciers of Glacier National Park and two additional glaciers on U.S. Forest Service’s Flathead National Forest land (the Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex) which borders GNP to the south. Establishing the rates of glacier retreat, using the decreasing area of glacier ice, is key to understanding the Glacier National Park ecosystem and future state of resources. For instance, glacial meltwater provides critical habitat for endangered stream insects. More broadly, retreating glaciers are indicative of long term climate change and have hydrologic and ecologic importance to many park resources. Glaciers and their retreat are of great interest to park visitors and the American public and are part of Glacier National Park's appeal. This is important because Glacier National Park is a major driver of the regional economy. Appropriate use of these data include comparing Glacier National Park's glacier area from different periods, such as previous years included in the data release, and from different parts of the world. The change in glacier area can be used to test models of glacier-climate interactions, and to estimate glacier contributions to streamflow.</purpose>
			<supplinf>This dataset represents the named glaciers of Glacier National Park (including 2 nearby glaciers on U.S. Forest Service’s Flathead National Forest land). The "named glaciers" constitute a subset of the total snow and ice inventory of the park and do not represent a comprehensive accounting of all glaciers or permanent ice features in the park. A subsequent dataset will be published that will include all cryospheric features and better represent the hydrologic contribution of ice and snow features of the park.  As glaciers shrink in size they leave behind remnants of ice and often break up into pieces of ice. The criteria used for determining which bodies of ice constituted a glacier were a) using the largest ice body remaining that was obviously separated by exposed rock from other ice bodies, and b) if the largest ice body was connected to other ice bodies by narrow strips of snow or ice, those other ice bodies were excluded if the strips were thought to be snow or if the (barely) attached ice body was very small relative to the main ice body and was not functioning as part of the glacier, e.g. showing any evidence of movement or contributing ice to the main body. An exception was made if the glacier had separated into two ice bodies of approximately the same size which were each large enough to be glaciers (0.1 km2) and/or were narrowly separated by a ledge where the upper ice body was still delivering ice to the lower body.</supplinf>

			<attraccr>Between three and five scientists digitized and reviewed the mapped perimeters of all named glaciers using the best images available and industry-standard mapping software. The location of mapped ice was finalized by consensus. Potential inaccuracies inherent to the imagery were not addressed except by excluding images that were visually distorted. Mapped perimeters were compared to a limited number of ground surveys using Global Positioning Systems (GPS), however, for recent imagery such as WorldView, the spatial resolution and accuracy of georeferencing were superior. WorldView, NAIP and other products downloaded from web sources were already corrected for spatial accuracy and were used as is, i.e. no additional geo- or ortho-rectification was conducted. https://evwhs.digitalglobe.com/ For each glacier, supplemental imagery was used to aid in interpreting the exact glacier perimeter. Parts of some perimeters were covered by rock debris or seasonal snow. Some glaciers, particularly those facing north or northeast, were deep in shadows and details in the shadowed areas were difficult to discern. Oblique terrestrial and aerial photography were compared to help delineate the perimeter in those cases. Photographs of all glaciers shot by John Scurlock in 2009 were the most useful. These are available at http://glaciers.research.pdx.edu/image-galleries/Lewis-Range-MT. In cases where imagery was not available or was poor in quality, images from the next or previous year were used. Thus, several glacier perimeters were digitized from 2016 or 2014 instead of 2015, as noted in the attribute table. Images with the lowest off-nadir angles were used whenever possible to keep spatial errors to a minimum.  The off-nadir angles are reported for each glacier’s image in the attribute table.</attraccr>
		</attracc>
		<logic>No formal logical accuracy tests were conducted.  Margins were delineated based on visual interpretation of glacial features, supplemented by cross-checking with multiple other images, both terrestrial oblique photography and other sources of aerial photography. GoogleEarth was used for interpreting 3-dimensional aspects of images from aerial and satellite photography.   There were no expected ranges per se. The expectation was that glaciers would shrink or possibly be static in size but would not grow. This occurred. Where glacier perimeters seemed as if they didn’t reflect likely location in the basin topography, extra efforts were made to assess whether rock debris was covering ice.</logic>
		<complete>Data set is considered complete for the information presented, as described in the abstract. The focus of this dataset was on the named glaciers of GNP, which represent the majority of the glaciers in the park, however, small ice patches and remnant glacial ice were not included in this survey.  In areas of heavy shading, image distortion, or where image quality was compromised in some way, which made margin delineation uncertain, supplemental imagery was used to best determine margin. Users are advised to read the rest of the metadata record and record attributes for additional details.</complete>
