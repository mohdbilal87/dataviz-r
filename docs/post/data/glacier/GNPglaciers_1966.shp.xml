			<abstract>The 1966 polygons included in this data release represent the main body portion of the 37 named glaciers of Glacier National Park (GNP) and 2 named glaciers on the U.S. Forest Service’s Flathead National Forest land. This is a subset of the original mapping effort derived from 1:24000 scale mapping of named glaciers and permanent snowfields within Glacier National Park, Montana which were digitized by Richard Menicke (Glacier National Park) and Carl Key (U.S. Geological Survey) in 1993. These data are based on USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle mapping published from 1966 through 1968 which were the result of the earliest park-wide aerial surveys of snow and ice features in GNP. Examination of the aerial photographs shows that seasonal snow was present at some of the glaciers, limiting the ability of the 1966-1968 cartographers to see and map the glacier ice margins. This resulted in some smoothed and generalized outlines of the glaciers where the cartographers were likely guessing where the ice margins were under the snow. In addition, some photographs show exposed glacier margin ice with irregular patterns that are not represented by the mapped ice margin. It appeared that the original cartographers used a more generalized outline for the glaciers and were not concerned with small scale ice features even when they were evident in the photographs. Despite the generalized nature of the glacier outlines, which were also limited by mapping technology and standards of the time, the dataset represents the baseline for the glacier margins derived from aerial photography. In several cases, because of the generalized nature of the 1966-1968 mapping, a glacier perimeter did not seem as if it reflected likely location in the basin topography. In these cases the original USGS aerial imagery was referred to for verification and revision if the error seemed significant. Specifics of margin revision are detailed in attribute files for those glaciers that warranted change as part of the time series analysis conducted by Dan Fagre and Lisa McKeon (USGS) in February - August, 2016. For each glacier, determination of what constituted the "main body" was made in accordance with USGS criteria outlined in Supplemental Information section of the xml file and some disconnected patches were eliminated in the interest of keeping this analysis strictly to glacier main bodies.</abstract>
			<purpose>The purpose of this dataset is to develop a time series and history of glacier recession in Glacier National Park, Montana, USA. This dataset consists of polygons that delineate the 1966 perimeters of the named glaciers of Glacier National Park and two additional glaciers on U.S. Forest Service’s Flathead National Forest land (the Bob Marshall Wilderness Complex) which borders GNP to the south.  Establishing the rates of glacier retreat, using the decreasing area of glacier ice, is key to understanding the Glacier National Park ecosystem and future state of resources. For instance, glacial meltwater provides critical habitat for endangered stream insects.  More broadly, retreating glaciers are indicative of long term climate change and have hydrologic and ecologic importance to many park resources.  Glaciers and their retreat are of great interest to park visitors and the American public and are part of Glacier National Park's appeal. This is important because Glacier National Park is a major driver of the regional economy. Appropriate use of these data include comparing Glacier National Park's glacier area from different periods, such as subsequent years included in the data release, and from different parts of the world. The change in glacier area can be used to test models of glacier-climate interactions, and to estimate glacier contributions to streamflow. A caveat to use of this dataset is the recognition that mapping technologies of 1966 were different from current technologies in accuracy and resolution. Thus, the glacier outlines in this dataset are more generalized than those from subsequent years included in this data release.</purpose>
			<supplinf>This dataset represents the named glaciers of Glacier National Park (including 2 nearby glaciers on U.S. Forest Service’s Flathead National Forest land). The "named glaciers" constitute a subset of the total snow and ice inventory of the park and do not represent a comprehensive accounting of all glaciers or permanent ice features in the park. A subsequent dataset will be published that will include all cryospheric features and better represent the hydrologic contribution of ice and snow features of the park. As glaciers shrink in size they leave behind remnants of ice and often break up into pieces of ice. The criteria used for determining which bodies of ice constituted a glacier were a) using the largest ice body remaining that was obviously separated by exposed rock from other ice bodies, and b) if the largest ice body was connected to other ice bodies by narrow strips of snow or ice, those other ice bodies were excluded if the strips were thought to be snow or if the (barely) attached ice body was very small relative to the main ice body and was not functioning as part of the glacier, e.g. showing any evidence of movement or contributing ice to the main body. An exception was made if the glacier had separated into two ice bodies of approximately the same size which were each large enough to be glaciers (0.1 km2) and/or were narrowly separated by a ledge where the upper ice body was still delivering ice to the lower body.</supplinf>

		<datacred>Richard Menicke, Glacier National Park GIS Coordinator, and Carl Key, USGS research scientist, made contributions to this dataset through their efforts of 1:24000 scale mapping of named glaciers and permanent snowfields within Glacier National Park, Montana. These data were based on USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle mapping published from 1966 through 1968. Their resulting shapefile served as the basis for analyzing the named glaciers of Glacier National Park in this analysis.</datacred>

			<attraccr>All attributes were from Glacier National Park’s Geographic Information System base layer for glaciers as digitized by Richard Menicke (Glacier National Park) and Carl Key (U.S. Geological Survey) from 1966-1968 USGS 7.5 minute quadrangle maps (see abstract). Values could differ from “true” values in two ways. The first is the accuracy in digitizing the glacier margins from the paper maps. Comparison of the glacier margins on the paper maps with the digital polygons indicates close adherence to the “true” values. The second way is the degree to which the glacier margins on the paper maps accurately reflect the margins shown in the photographs. As previously noted, cartographers had to interpret where glacier margins were when seasonal snow covered some margins or in cases where the photograph was of poor quality due to presence of clouds. The tendency to make more generalized glacier outlines was previously noted. The degree of oversight and quality control in mapping margins from the 1966 photographs is not known to us but would have followed the generally high standards of the U.S. Geological Survey for that era. For each glacier, determination of what constituted the "main body" was made in accordance with USGS criteria outlined in “Supplemental Information” and some disconnected patches were eliminated in the interest of keeping this analysis strictly to glacier main bodies. In several cases, because of the generalized nature of the 1966-1968 mapping, a glacier perimeter did not seem as if it reflected likely location in the basin topography.  In these cases the original USGS aerial imagery was referred to for verification and revision if the error seemed significant. Specifics of revision for any glacier is detailed in attribute file.</attraccr>

		<logic>Polygon and arc-node topology does not exist. The data set is in ESRI shapefile format.  No formal logical accuracy tests were conducted.  Margins were delineated by cartographers in 1966-1968 based on visual interpretation of glacial features as indicated on USGS 1:24000 scale 7.5 Minute Quadrangle Map Series. Those maps were used to digitize the glacier polygons that constitute this dataset.  Where glacier perimeters seemed as if they didn’t reflect likely location in the basin topography, e.g. crossing a basin divide, the original photographs were examined to make sure that a major mapping error had not occurred in producing the 1966-1968 maps.</logic>
		<complete>Data set is considered complete for the information presented, as described in the abstract. The focus of this dataset was on the named glaciers of GNP, which represent the majority of the glaciers in the park, however, small ice patches and remnant glacial ice were not included in this survey. Users are advised to read the rest of the metadata record and record attributes for additional details.</complete>
